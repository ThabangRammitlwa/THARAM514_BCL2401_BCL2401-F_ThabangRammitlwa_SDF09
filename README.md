# Tailwind-css
# Learning Reflections README 
At first i did not really understand what is expected from us.I thought it will be more complex like the previous projects, to my suprise it was short and straigt forward.i wouldn't necessarely say i fully understand Tailwind , but it doesn't look that complicated.This project felt more like an introduction than a challenge.

### Overview
Iam intrested in understanding it fully as it looks way easier to use and short.Tailwind seem way more straight forward , i hope it doesn't get complicated.

### Reflections
I do not have much to reflect on as i already mention thaat it felt more like and indroction to a new topic than a challenge, we had a guide ,of which it made the whole thing simple
#### Areas of Mastery
still to soon to can say what i master or what i would like to master, this is the first Tailwind practice

#### Challenges Faced
None
- **Tailwind-css**:
 It seems to be short and straight forwad method of coding.
- **Code Optimization**:
 My code gave results, but i would like to do more of this kind to understand and probably master it.
#### Overall Learning Experience
It was not that challenging, it was more of a copy and paste, read and follow instruction.
